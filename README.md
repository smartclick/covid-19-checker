## Things to do
​
[X] - Deploy the best pretrained repo (modified version of arnoweng's repo is deployed)  
[ ] - Combine datasets   
[ ] - Train classifier on pneumonia detection  
[ ] - Fine-tune the model on COVID-19  

# Model performance
The model has 93% on detecting one of the 14 conditions. The model has been tested on a limited dataset.
